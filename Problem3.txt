Problem 3:

The suggested int starTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); endTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); methods were too slow to track the timing of the code fragments, so instead I tracked it in nano seconds with System.nanoTime(). The results were as following:

Function 1:
n = 100		timing = 36790 nanoseconds
n = 500		timing = 95112 nanoseconds
n = 1000	timing = 255631 nanoseconds
n = 10000	timing = 1433438 nanoseconds

Function 2
n = 100		timing = 47778 nanoseconds
n = 500		timing = 894487 nanoseconds
n = 1000	timing = 2016938 nanoseconds
n = 10000	timing = 5161118 nanoseconds

foo
k is always = 2

n = 100		timing = 4798 nanoseconds
n = 500		timing = 2863 nanoseconds
n = 1000	timing = 2916 nanoseconds
n = 10000	timing = 3590 nanoseconds

I believe that the results reflect my predictions with the Big O analysis.
