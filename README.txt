The solutions to the written portion of the HW can be found in the docx document.

The programming portion was written using eclipse and follows the directions laid out in the assignment.

Rectangle.java creates a rectangle class with length and width properties as well as getLength, getWidth, and getPerimeter methods. It is comparable to other Rectangles by Perimeter length.

Problem1 utilizes this class to create an array of Rectangles and return the largest Perimeter length using the findMax method.

Problem2 continues to utilize this class and sorts it by Perimeter length using a binary search after the array is sorted by length.

Finally Problem3 (see Problem3.txt) times the completion of the code fragments from question 3 of the written section to test my Big Oh analysis.
